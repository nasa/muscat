## üß© Core Architecture

MuSCAT is built on a robust architecture that prioritizes modularity, extensibility, and clarity. Understanding these design principles will help you leverage MuSCAT effectively for your mission simulations.

### The Mission Structure

The central data structure in MuSCAT is the `mission` structure, which serves as the global state container for the entire simulation:

```matlab
% Mission structure example
mission = [];
mission.name = 'YourMission';
mission.num_SC = 1;                % Number of spacecraft
mission.num_target = 1;            % Number of targets (asteroids, etc.)
mission.frame = 'Absolute';        % Reference frame type
mission.true_time = [];            % Time parameters
mission.true_SC = {};              % Array of spacecraft objects
```

This structure provides a unified interface for all components to access simulation data. Each spacecraft contains numerous subsystems organized within this structure:

```matlab
% Spacecraft subsystems
mission.true_SC{1}.true_SC_body          % Physical properties
mission.true_SC{1}.true_SC_navigation    % Position and velocity
mission.true_SC{1}.true_SC_adc           % Attitude dynamics and control
mission.true_SC{1}.true_SC_power         % Power subsystem
mission.true_SC{1}.true_SC_camera{1}     % Camera hardware
mission.true_SC{1}.software_SC_executive % Flight software
```

### Dual-Loop Architecture

One of MuSCAT's most powerful features is its dual-loop architecture, which efficiently handles different timescales:

```matlab
% Outer loop - Orbital dynamics (slower, typically 5 seconds)
for k = 1:1:mission.true_time.num_time_steps
    % Update orbital position, subsystems, etc.
    
    % Inner loop - Attitude dynamics (faster, typically 0.1 seconds)
    for k_attitude = 1:1:mission.true_time.num_time_steps_attitude
        % Update attitude, sensors, actuators, etc.
    end
end
```

This approach provides high fidelity for fast-changing attitude dynamics while maintaining computational efficiency for long-duration mission simulations.

### Standard Interface Pattern

All MuSCAT components follow a consistent interface pattern that makes extending the framework straightforward:

```matlab
% Standard update function pattern
function func_main_component_name(obj, mission, i_SC, i_HW)
    % Update component state based on current mission state
    % ... component-specific logic ...
    
    % Store data if needed
    func_store_data(obj, mission);
end
```

### Creating Your Own Mission

Implementing your own mission in MuSCAT is straightforward and follows this general process:

1. **Start with a template**: Copy an existing mission file (e.g., `Mission_DART.m`) as a starting point
2. **Configure basic parameters**: Set mission name, spacecraft count, and time parameters
3. **Define spacecraft properties**: Set physical properties, initial position, and attitude
4. **Configure hardware**: Specify the sensors, actuators, and other components
5. **Implement flight software**: Create custom control logic for your specific mission
6. **Run and analyze**: Execute the simulation and analyze the results

MuSCAT is designed to be extended without modifying core files. Instead, you can:

```matlab
% Example: Creating a custom mission with a specialized control mode
% In your mission file:
init_data.mode_software_SC_control_attitude_selector = 'YourCustomMode';

% In Software_SC_Control_Attitude.m, add your implementation:
function obj = func_software_SC_control_attitude_YourCustomMode(obj, mission, i_SC)
    % Your custom attitude control logic here
end
```

MuSCAT's object-oriented design allows for modular extension, letting you customize specific components while keeping the core simulation engine intact.
